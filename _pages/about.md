Hi! I am Esha, a second year undergraduate student at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in) passionate about improving human health through the confluence of technology and medicine. My research interests lie at the intersection of neuroimmunology, endocrinology, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. 

I have leveraged computational modeling, data science and machine learning to find innovative solutions to diabetes management.


Outside of academia I love running, yoga and learning korean!
